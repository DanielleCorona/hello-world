# About Me

My name is Danielle Corona. I'm in my last semester of the UW-Madison MLIS program where I have focused on anything data related.  I am also currently working as a data analytics intern at Thermo Fisher Scientific where I am learning how to build data dashboards using Power BI.  I previously received my bachelor's in Computer Science from UW back in 2010.  In the 10 years between my bachelor's and master's degrees, I worked for 5 years as a supply chain manager for an online retailer and another 5 years as a wage analyst for the state's Worker's Comp Division.

Out side of school and work, my wife and I are moms to a very energetic 4-year-old kiddo. I don't have much free time now, but I am an avid reader (more so when I'm not in grad school and drowning in assigned pdfs lol). Typically, I love reading character-driven contemporary fiction...but really, I'll give anything a try.  Also, very into journaling (and with that stickers and pens and washi tape etc), which has me throwing all of my money to my favorite store in Madison: [Anthology](https://www.anthologymadison.com/).

## Academic and Professional Interests
- Data analytics
- Database management and design
- Recommendation systems (think: "you liked this show, how about trying these shows next") and the bias found in these systems 
- Predictive analytics
- Where computer science can fit into fields other than strictly "software programmer" (hi, digital humanities)
- Women in computer science 

## Tools and Methods I'm Looking Forward to Learning About
- I'm brand new to **Git** and **GitHub**, so definitely excited to learn these
- I have worked with **Python**, but I'm still kind of new to it so looking forward to more experience
- Excited to learn more about any digital humanities **data visualization** tools that are available to work with
